## Initial Setup

You can find all the Python dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file. It is recommended to use a
`conda` managed environment

Running the following command will set up a `conda` environment automatically, assuming `conda` is
installed ([instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)).

```bash
. init_workspace.sh
```
